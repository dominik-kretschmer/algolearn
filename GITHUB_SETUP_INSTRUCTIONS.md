# GitHub Setup Instructions

## What has been done:

1. Git has been initialized in the project
2. All project files have been added and committed
3. The README.md has been updated with GitHub setup instructions

## Next steps to complete GitHub setup:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name the repository "algolearn" (or your preferred name)
   - Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Connect your local repository to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/algolearn.git
   ```
   (Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

3. Push your local repository to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin master
   ```

4. Verify that your repository has been successfully pushed to GitHub by visiting:
   https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/algolearn

## Additional information:

- If you're using GitHub authentication with SSH instead of HTTPS, use the SSH URL format:
  ```sh
  git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/algolearn.git
  ```

- If you want to rename the default branch from "master" to "main" (GitHub's current default):
  ```sh
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```

Your project is now ready to be pushed to GitHub!
